Another tetris clone, just for fun.
Works fine and looks pretty neet.



TODO

FIXES:

Fix the overwriting of solid blocks by new appearing blocks



REFACTORING

Make the lookahead for the cleared lines above dynamically instead of
  with the static array in subroutine turn_is_over()
Make rotate_clockwise() more compact, there is too much repeating code
Define all the nonglobal variables as locals
Bring all the subroutines arguments in a consistent order: (figure_number, figure(), root_block_x, root_block_y)



FEATURES

Syntax check of topscore file
Expand the field space so figures may stick out of field top when rotated
Displaying the keydescription, i.g. "Esc for exit"
Change color scheme of the brick with every 10 lines



DONE recently


Add blinking cursor for topscore entry screen
