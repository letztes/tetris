Another tetris clone, just for fun.
Works fine and looks pretty neet.



TODO

FIXES:

Fix the overwriting of solid blocks by new appearing blocks



REFACTORING

Make the lookahead for the cleared lines above dynamically instead of
  with the static array in subroutine turn_is_over()
Make rotate_clockwise() more compact, there is too much repeating code
Define all the nonglobal variables as locals
Bring all the subroutines arguments in a consistent order: (figure_number, figure(), root_block_x, root_block_y)



FEATURES

Expand the field space so figures may stick out of field top when rotated
Add a csv file for top score storage
Displaying the keydescription, i.g. "Esc for exit"
Brickrotation counterclockwise
Change color scheme of the brick with every 10 lines



DONE
